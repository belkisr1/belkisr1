🚀 Projects Highlights

Apartment Machine Learning Module (July 2025): Developed an end-to-end Machine Learning model to predict apartment prices. I conducted deep Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to handle missing values and outliers, engineered features like 'price-per-square-foot,' and deployed the trained model locally using Streamlit.

Weather Analysis (May 2025): Combined Brazilian weather and crop output datasets using Python (Pandas) to analyze the influence of rainfall, temperature, and humidity on coffee growth and identify key weather factors.


💡 Currently Working On

Refining the Apartment Machine Learning Module with more advanced feature engineering and exploring different regression algorithms to improve prediction accuracy.

Developing new reports, dashboards, and visualizations for non-technical staff, building on my experience as a Pro Bono Data Analyst at Boulder Ballet.



📚 Currently Learning

Deepening my knowledge of A/B Testing and experimental design for effective data-driven solution validation.

Advanced techniques in SQL for complex data extraction and high-volume transaction analysis, building on my experience from American Express.

🤝 I’m Looking to Collaborate On

Open-source Data Science projects focused on predictive modeling and forecasting.

Projects that require strong data storytelling and developing clear, comprehensive dashboards for client-facing analytics.
